# CS7367 KBAI

Contains my code submissions for the CS7637 course for Spring 2021.

Create a development environment matching the GradeScope environment using `pyenv`:

```
pyenv install 3.8.0
pyenv virtualenv 3.8.0 kbai
pyenv activate kbai
pip install numpy pillow opencv-contrib-python-headless==4.2.0.34
```

Activate the environment every time with `pyenv activate kbai` to ensure environment conformity.
